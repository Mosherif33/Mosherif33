## 🧰 Developer in the Wild

Strategic and performance-driven **Full-Stack Developer**, primarily focused on **Laravel + Vue** ecosystems. I build secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications that don’t require a fire extinguisher every sprint.

I thrive on writing clean backend code in PHP, exploring JS frameworks, and figuring out how to Dockerize anything that dares run on a server. I am currently upskilling in React, Next.js, and Python because why stop at one frontend framework or one compiled language?
